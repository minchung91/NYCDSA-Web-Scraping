# NYCDSAWebScraping

For our first major project of the bootcamp, I web scraped two websites as a preliminary study on automobile sales trends in America. My aim was to first explain the car-buying process and complexity of narrowing a car search and to explore the recent sales trends of new and used cars sold in America. Selenium was utilized for the web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization.
